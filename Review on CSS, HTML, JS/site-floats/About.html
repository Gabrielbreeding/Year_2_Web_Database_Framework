            Just two good ol' boys Wouldn't change if they could. 
            Fightin' the system like a true modern day Robin Hood. 
            Believe it or not I'm walking on air. I never thought 
            I could feel so free. They call him Flipper Flipper 
            faster than lightning. No one you see is smarter than 
            he. And if you threw a party - invited everyone you knew. 
            You would see the biggest gift would be from me and the 
            card attached would say thank you for being a friend. 
            Come and play. Everything's A-OK. Friendly neighbors 
            there that's where we meet. Can you tell me how to get 
            how to get to Sesame Street.

            The year is 1987 and NASA launches the last of Americas 
            deep space probes. Got kind of tired packin' and unpackin' 
            - town to town and up and down the dial. Baby if you've 
            ever wondered - wondered whatever became of me. I'm living 
            on the air in Cincinnati. Cincinnati WKRP. That this group 
            would somehow form a family that's the way we all became 
            the Brady Bunch. Were gonna do it. Give us any chance well 
            take it. Give us any rule we'll break it. We're gonna make 
            our dreams come true. Well we're movin' on up to the east 
            side to a deluxe apartment in the sky. Maybe you and me 
            were never meant to be. But baby think of me once in 
            awhile. I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati.
